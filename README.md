The "Bench Loong," also known as "Panlong," is a traditional folk activity in the Zhejiang and Fujian regions of China, usually held during the Lantern Festival. This activity involves connecting multiple benches end to end to form a long, dragon-like line. During the dragon dance, the dragon head leads the dragon body and tail in a spiraling motion, creating a coiled pattern that showcases unique cultural characteristics.

Structure of the Bench Loong: It consists of a dragon head bench, dragon body benches, and a dragon tail bench. Each bench has a width of 30 cm, and each bench has a hole with a diameter of 5.5 cm located 27.5 cm from each end, used to insert handles that connect the benches into a dragon. Except for the dragon head bench, which is 341 cm in length, the other benches (i.e., the body and tail) are each 220 cm long.

Problem 1: The Bench Loong team coils inward starting from point A on the 16th turn of an equidistant spiral with a pitch of 55 cm, with the front handle of the dragon head maintaining a constant speed of 1 m/s. Calculate the center position and velocity of each handle (including those of the dragon head, body, and tail) every second during the first 300 seconds, accurate to six decimal places.

Problem 2: Assuming the Bench Loong team coils inward as described in Problem 1, determine the maximum duration the team can continue coiling without any collision. Also calculate the positions and velocities of the team at the moment of termination.

Problem 3: The Bench Loong coils along a spiral with a constant pitch and enters a turning area, which is a circle with a radius of 4.5 m centered at the spiral’s origin. Calculate the minimum pitch of the spiral that allows the dragon head to reach the turning area without any collision.

Problem 4: Within the circular turning area defined in Problem 3, the Bench Loong must execute a turn using an S-shaped curve composed of two tangential arc segments. The two arcs have a radius ratio of 2:1 and are respectively tangent to the incoming and outgoing spirals. The incoming and outgoing spirals must be symmetric about the origin of the spiral. Under these constraints, the actual turning radius may be smaller than 4.5 m. Optimize the turning path to minimize the total curve length. When the front handle of the dragon head passes through the turning curve at a constant speed of 1 m/s, with the start of the turn defined as time zero, provide the positions and velocities of the Bench Loong every second from -100 s to 100 s.

Problem 5: The Bench Loong follows the path defined in Problem 4, with the dragon head moving at a constant speed. Determine the maximum speed the dragon head can maintain such that the speed of every handle in the team does not exceed 2 m/s.


For the motion problem of the Bench Loong along an Archimedean spiral, multiple mathematical models were established using methods such as arc length integration, implicit function solving, and collision detection, to analyze the motion state and path optimization of the Loong.

For Problem 1: First, based on the given information, the spiral equation and the coordinates of the entry point were determined. Using the arc length integration formula and the constant forward speed of the dragon head, the position of the dragon head at any given time was obtained. Then, an iterative model was built to describe the motion of the dragon body. Through coordinate transformation between polar and Cartesian systems and bench length constraints, recursive implicit functions for the coordinates of adjacent handles were derived. Furthermore, based on the physical constraint that the velocity components of the two holes on the same bench in the bench’s direction are equal, recursive formulas for the velocities of adjacent handles were derived. A program was written to solve the implicit functions using the Newton-Raphson method, allowing calculation of the positions and velocities of all handles during the first 300 seconds.

For Problem 2: First, based on the kinematic features of the bench and the geometric properties of the curve, it was proven that the first collision must occur between the tip of the dragon head bench and an outer dragon body bench. Then, utilizing the spiral’s characteristics, a collision detection mechanism was established by checking whether the two outermost corners of the dragon head bench fall inside their respective outer-layer dragon body benches. This mechanism effectively reduced algorithmic complexity. Using a variable step-size iterative method, it was found that the first collision occurs at 412.48 seconds. 

For Problem 3: Building on the collision detection mechanism from Problem 2, the relationship between spiral pitch and the dragon head position at the first collision was derived. Noting that within a certain range, the relationship between pitch and collision radius is not monotonic, a curve was plotted using a pitch step size of 0.01 m. In its monotonic intervals, the minimum pitch was computed using the bisection method, resulting in a minimum pitch of 0.451 m.

For Problem 4: First, it was proven that no collision occurs during the movement of the Bench Loong with a spiral pitch of 1.7 m. Then, based on geometric symmetry and the condition of tangent arcs, a U-turn path composed of two arc segments was constructed. To optimize path length, geometric constraints ensuring the smooth entry and exit of the dragon head bench into the turning area were identified, and a single-objective optimization model was established. Using simulated annealing, the actual minimum turning area radius was found to be 4.28 m, and the shortest turning path was 12.93 m. Subsequently, the potential locations of each handle were divided into four sections: the incoming spiral, arc 1, arc 2, and the outgoing spiral. The positions of the Bench Loong at various time points were solved by segment-wise and curve-wise iteration , and then velocity information was computed in segments using speed constraints .

For Problem 5: First, based on the physical constraint that the velocity components along the bench direction are the same for both handles on a bench, it was determined that the velocities of all handles are proportional under any fixed configuration of the Bench Loong. Then, by identifying the spatial position where the velocity of any handle reached its maximum in the results of Problem 4, the speed of that handle was scaled to 2 m/s, and using the velocity proportionality relationship, the corresponding maximum speed of the front handle of the dragon head was obtained. The maximum constant speed of the dragon head’s front handle was finally calculated to be 1.02 m/s.
