Design and analysis of the movement route of "Bench Loong" on planar equidistant spiral track

The "Bench Loong," also known as "Panlong," is a traditional folk activity in the Zhejiang and Fujian regions of China, usually held during the Lantern Festival. This activity involves connecting multiple benches end to end to form a long, dragon-like line. During the dragon dance, the dragon head leads the dragon body and tail in a spiraling motion, creating a coiled pattern that showcases unique cultural characteristics.

Structure of the Bench Loong: It consists of a dragon head bench, dragon body benches, and a dragon tail bench. Each bench has a width of 30 cm, and each bench has a hole with a diameter of 5.5 cm located 27.5 cm from each end, used to insert handles that connect the benches into a dragon. Except for the dragon head bench, which is 341 cm in length, the other benches (i.e., the body and tail) are each 220 cm long.

Problem 1: The Bench Loong team coils inward starting from point A on the 16th turn of an equidistant spiral with a pitch of 55 cm, with the front handle of the dragon head maintaining a constant speed of 1 m/s. Calculate the center position and velocity of each handle (including those of the dragon head, body, and tail) every second during the first 300 seconds, accurate to six decimal places.

Problem 2: Assuming the Bench Loong team coils inward as described in Problem 1, determine the maximum duration the team can continue coiling without any collision. Also calculate the positions and velocities of the team at the moment of termination.

Problem 3: The Bench Loong coils along a spiral with a constant pitch and enters a turning area, which is a circle with a radius of 4.5 m centered at the spiralâ€™s origin. Calculate the minimum pitch of the spiral that allows the dragon head to reach the turning area without any collision.

Problem 4: Within the circular turning area defined in Problem 3, the Bench Loong must execute a turn using an S-shaped curve composed of two tangential arc segments. The two arcs have a radius ratio of 2:1 and are respectively tangent to the incoming and outgoing spirals. The incoming and outgoing spirals must be symmetric about the origin of the spiral. Under these constraints, the actual turning radius may be smaller than 4.5 m. Optimize the turning path to minimize the total curve length. When the front handle of the dragon head passes through the turning curve at a constant speed of 1 m/s, with the start of the turn defined as time zero, provide the positions and velocities of the Bench Loong every second from -100 s to 100 s.

Problem 5: The Bench Loong follows the path defined in Problem 4, with the dragon head moving at a constant speed. Determine the maximum speed the dragon head can maintain such that the speed of every handle in the team does not exceed 2 m/s.
